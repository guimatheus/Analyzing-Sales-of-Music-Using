# Analyzing-Sales-of-Music
This is the second Udacity project in the Data Foundation Nanodegree. This project focused on using SQL to parse and analyze the data to answer a series of questions. The data is a database of sales of songs that includes albums, artists, tracks, price, units sold, date sold, the location of customers and employee information. All analysis was conducted using SQL. All visualizations were created in Excel and presented in PowerPoint.
